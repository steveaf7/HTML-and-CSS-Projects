			<h3>This website is about drums, dogs, and other stuff.</h3>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum">
				<p>Drumming may be a purposeful expression of emotion for entertainment, spiritualism and communication. Many cultures practice drumming as a spiritual or religious passage and interpret drummed rhythm similarly to spoken language or prayer. Drumming has developed over millennia to be a powerful art form. Drumming is commonly viewed as the root of music and is sometimes performed as a kinesthetic dance. As a discipline, drumming concentrates on training the body to punctuate, convey and interpret musical rhythmic intention to an audience and to the performer.</p>

			<h1>Drums</h1>
				<p>I have been playing drums since I was 10. I played in the band Cirka:Sik from 2012 to 2017. This is a video we made at a fun show in a pool where the host was also a firebreather.</p>
